  <h1>Types of Supernatural Monsters</h1>
  <h2> Ghosts </h2>
  <p> The average supernatural being is a ghost, or a spirit or some other name for a ghost. You can't see these spirits unless they want you to see them. If you feel there is a ghost in your house, call us ASAP! </p>
     <h2> Vampires </h2>
  <p> Yes, they are real. If you see a person with an umbrella in the sunlight, someone with oddly sharp canines, or someone who won't eat garlic they are probably a vampire. We recommend you call us immediately! </p>
     <h2> WereWolves </h2>
  <p> Do you hear a dog howling or barking at night, heads up, it's not a dog it's a werewolf! Call us as soon as you hear it, but like in the morning preferably. We might not be awake that late. Actually wait until like the middle of the day, just in case we don't wake up early either. </p>
     <h2> Other stuff! </h2>
  <p> If you see, hear, smell etc. something weird than call us. It'll probably be something supernatural, and if you don't reach out to us <strong>you are responsible for anything that happens. </strong> </p>
